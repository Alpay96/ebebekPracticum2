<b>Leap Year Calculator<b> <br>
  As a general rule, leap years are years that are a multiple of 4. <br>
  Years that are a multiple of 100 are leap years only if they are divisible by 400 without a remainder. <br>
  The reason why only those exactly divisible by 400 are considered leap years is to correct the error that an astronomical year is approximately 365.242 days, not 365.25 days.
